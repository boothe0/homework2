      Intro Video

    <p>
      Hi! I am a sophmore in college at NAU majoring in Software Engineering.
      <br />
      I work with C and C++ as have explored both embedded systems and game
      development. <br />Since both Raspberry Pi and Arduino can use C
      programming I have been <br />
      practicing my skills with both these microcontrollers. I have also used
      unity <br />game engine to see what is possible when combining art and
      code together.
    </p>

    <h4>Projects</h4>
    <h5>MIPS Assembly Random Number Generator</h5>

    <p>
      This project introduced me to lower level languages and their application
      to <br />
      physical electronics. MIPS uses registers which correlate to memory
      directly <br />on the chip. I used an <sup>*</sup>algorithm which
      simulated a random generator.
    </p>
    <small>
      The algorithm involved used a seed which made it look like the numbers
      were random however,<br />
      when using the same seed the same numbers would be the output. In MIPS it
      is impossible to get a truely random generator.

    <h5>DNA Alignment</h5>

    <p>
      The user is prompted to press continue in order to generate a random DNA
      <br />
      string that is then compared with another one to test similarity. This can
      be <br />modified to take in a file with nucleotides on it to be more
      useful in a medical setting.
